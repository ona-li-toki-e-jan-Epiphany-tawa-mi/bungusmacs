# bungusmacs

Bungusmacs is my personal Emacs configuration, which is on GitHub for my convienience.

Take a look inside [init.el](init.el) for an overview on what features it has.

## Installation

If you would like to install bungusmacs yourself for whatever reason, simply clone the files of this repository into the directory `~/.emacs.d` on your system and reload Emacs. Then, check [init.el](init.el) for any post-install instructions.
